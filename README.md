# CornLeafNet-Based-on-K-Means-Clustering-and-Deep-Learning
In this project we effectively segment the corn leaf from complex backgrounds poses a challenge for accurate disease detection.
The problem is addressed by implementing data augmentation techniques and employing a K-means algorithm for segmentation,followed by a Deep Neural Network(DNN) for precise and efficient classification in corn leaf disease detection.
